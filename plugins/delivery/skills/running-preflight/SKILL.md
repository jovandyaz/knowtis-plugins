# Preflight

Run the checks CI will run, locally, and report a verdict. Execute all steps even if an early one fails — the point is a complete picture.

## Steps

```bash
# 1. What does this change touch?
pnpm nx show projects --affected --base=main --head=HEAD

# 2. Affected lint and typecheck:
pnpm nx affected -t lint typecheck --base=main --head=HEAD

# 3. Affected tests with CI's runner limits:
pnpm nx affected -t test --parallel=2 --outputStyle=stream --base=main --head=HEAD -- --run

# 4. Affected production builds:
pnpm nx affected -t build --configuration=production --base=main --head=HEAD

# 5. Generate from the current schema and reject migration drift:
pnpm nx db:generate api
git diff --exit-code -- apps/api/drizzle/
```

## Report format

End with a verdict block:

- **SHIP** — all green; list affected projects and deploy jobs (notes/backoffice → Vercel, API/MCP → Railway).
- **NO-SHIP** — list every failure with the exact command and first relevant error lines, then give the fix order (lint → types → tests → migrations → build).
